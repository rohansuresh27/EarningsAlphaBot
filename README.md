# EarningsAlpha Bot 🤖📊

[EarningsAlpha Twitter/X Bot](https://x.com/EarningsAlpha_)

An automated earnings call analysis bot that extracts high-value insights from company earnings transcripts using the Claude API. The bot processes earnings call PDFs, identifies key strategic insights, executive quotes, and market-moving revelations, then shares them on Twitter/X to make institutional-grade earnings analysis accessible to everyone.

Perfect for investors and finance enthusiasts who want to stay on top of earnings season without reading lengthy transcripts.

## Key Features
- 📝 Processes earnings call transcripts using Claude API
- 🔍 Extracts forward-looking statements and strategic shifts from uploaded PDFs
- 💡 Identifies unexpected revelations from Q&A sessions
- 🐦 Automatically formats and schedules tweets

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Anthropic's Claude API
- Replit to build the project

## Project Status: Temporarily Discontinued

**Reason:** This project has been temporarily suspended due to unsustainable costs associated with the Twitter API. The free tier limit is not enough to cover insights for even the most significant listed companies.

### Current Limitations:
- The daily max post limit is 17.
- Twitter API v2 restricts posts to a maximum of 280 characters.
- Twitter Blue subscription does not increase the character limit for API usage.

### Future Plans:
Plan to revisit and potentially resume this project if/when Twitter increases the post character limit for API users.
